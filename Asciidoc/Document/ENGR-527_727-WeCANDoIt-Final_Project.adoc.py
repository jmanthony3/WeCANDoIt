The remainder were able to be purchased from McMaster-Carr.\r\n\r\nTo determine the required crushing force for an aluminum beverage can, six uniaxial compression tests were conducted and the results are shown in xref:fig-can_plot[].\r\nThe average maximum crushing force was found to be approximately stem:[1.3~kN] to reduce the can to stem:[20\\%] of the original volume.\r\nFor the dimensions of an aluminum beverage can, the can was considered to have an original height of stem:[157~mm] and to achieve stem:[80\\%] reduction in volume, the can would need to be deformed to a thickness of stem:[31.4~mm].\r\nThe dimensions of the can were determined via measurements taken from the beverage cans used in the compression tests.\r\nFurthermore, from the project instructions, the final design was required to have the ability to be either mechanically or electrically driven.\r\nAdditionally, the requirement of having the crushing mechanism automatically reload was added to improve the total throughput of the cans to be crushed.\r\nThe metric for the human force and crushing force are determined via mechanical analysis.\r\nFor the material selection, the commercially listed for the components will be used in the design.\r\n\r\n[#fig-can_plot]\r\n.Results from crushing six different aluminum soda cans with the regions of buckling and maximum force denoted. \r\nimage::./compression_results.png[caption=<span class="floatnumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}", role=text-center, width=50%]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-synthesis, {counter:secs}]\r\n== Synthesis of the Design\r\n:!subs:\r\n:!figs:\r\n:!tabs:\r\n\r\nIn creating the final design of the system, several commercially and custom fabricated can crushing solutions were considered.\r\nWhile the common lever-based design (xref:fig-manual_device[]) allows for a can to be easily crushed, the challenge arises in creating an automated and high-throughput can crushing device.\r\nThe common industrial devices serve to shred rather than compress the aluminum cans for use in recycling facilities.\r\nBy investigating Do-It-Yourself (DIY) designs, a common method for automating the process is to create a crank-slider mechanism to compress the can.\r\nHowever, the number of moving parts in the design creates a higher likelihood of component failure if the device is operated for long periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe design of the proposed device functions on the use of a "cam" with varying thickness to compress the aluminum can against the wall of the device.\r\nThe thickness of the cam varies angularly allowing for a gradual crushing of the can.\r\nOnce the can has been reduce to stem:[20\\%] of the original volume, the can exits the device via a slot in the bottom of the housing.\r\nAs the wheel completes a revolution, the opening for a can reaches the can entry location and allows the can to drop into the crushing area.\r\nThe cam is suggested to be made from cast stainless steel.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of the cam is hexagonal and purchased from McMaster-Carr and is made from AISI 316 cite:[mcmaster-carrCorrosionResistant316316L2021].\r\nIn the current iteration, a handle purchased from McMaster-Carr cite:[mcmaster-carrCrankHandleMachinable2021] is attached to the shaft and a human is expected to provide the required rotational input to the device.\r\nHowever, a coupler could be used to attach the shaft to a motor to improve the rate of compression for the cans.\r\nThe device is shown in xref:fig-design[].\r\n\r\n[#fig-design]\r\n.Design of the can crushing device with a potion of the housing cut away to view internal crushing chamber.\r\nimage::./design.png[caption=<span class="floatnumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}", role=text-center, width=50%]\r\n\r\n[#fig-manual_device]\r\n.Example of a common design for manual can crushing devices.\r\nimage::./manual_device.jpg[caption=<span class="floatnumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}", role=text-center, width=50%]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-design, {counter:secs}]\r\n== Design Analysis and Optimization\r\n:!subs:\r\n:!figs:\r\n:!tabs:\r\n\r\nFor analyzing the design of the can crushing mechanism, the analysis was broken down into two type: analytical and FEA.\r\nThe analytical work focused on two points of interested: a point on the handle, and a point on the cross-section of the shaft.

{secs}-{figs}", role=text-center, width=50%]\r\n\r\nThe handle of the mechanism is subject to a moment produced by the force applied to the handle(see xref:fig-handle_fbd[]).\r\nSince the cross-section of the bar is rectangular, the standard equation for bending is applied.\r\nAt the end of the handle, a force of stem:[20~\\text{lb}_f], which is the human strength found from NASA cite:[christensenman], is applied.\r\nThe handle has a length, stem:[L = 11~in] with a cross-sectional area of stem:[0.75~inches~\\times~0.6~in].\r\nUsing the equation for bending stress at point stem:[A] on the cross-section:\r\n\r\n[stem#eq-rect-cross-section, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}"]\r\n++++\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\sigma_A = \\frac{M\\ y}{I}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\n++++\r\nwhere

maximum normal stress of stem:[24.8~MPa].\r\nOnce again, this closely matches the results determined in the FEA analysis near the point of interest.\r\n\r\n==== Conclusions\r\nWithin the brief analytical work conducted, both the shear stress in the shaft and the maximum normal stress are both well below the limits of the material.\r\nFor the cam, an FEA approach is employed due to the complex geometry of the contact surface with the can.\r\nThe checks provided by the analytical work confirm that the FEA results are close to the predicted values.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-design-fea, {counter:subs}]\r\n=== Finite Element Analysis (FEA)\r\nReferring to xref:sec-design-analytical[], recall that the maximum shear stress calculated for the shaft was stem:[8.646~MPa], and the maximum stress due to bending in the handle was calculated to be stem:[24.8~MPa].\r\nMechanical loads of stem:[202.5~\\text{lb}_f\\cdot\\text{in}] and stem:[1.3~kN] were applied to the handle and the crushing face of the cam, respectively.\r\nThe input torque causes the shaft to rotate which, in turn, forces the can to be crushed by the reduction of available space from the cam.\r\nIf the cam withstands the average reacting force from the can (stem:[1.3~kN]), then the cam should also withstand every prerequisite reaction force (as seen in the force-displacement curve xref:fig-can_plot[]).\r\nFinite Element Analyses were carried out in *SolidWorks 2016-17* to verify these analytical calculations for the maximum stresses seen in the shaft and handle.\r\nA mesh refinement study was also performed to validate the FEA results.\r\n\r\n==== Mesh Refinement\r\nTo determine the appropriate mesh element size and the sufficient number of elements needed for calculations, the mesh element size is gradually decreased such that the number of mesh elements increases.\r\nThe more elements there exist in a study, the more precise the solution will be.\r\nHowever, the solution will take much longer to solve which may also become more inaccurate due to truncation errors.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this concept clearly, xref:fig-fea-mesh_refinement-shaft[] plots the percent difference of the maximum shear stress seen in the shaft between some mesh and the next finer mesh.\r\nBy increasing the number of mesh elements, the percent difference decreases from stem:[\\sim 15\\%] at stem:[14,479] elements down to stem:[\\sim 1\\%] at stem:[56,842] elements.\r\nHowever, there is a considerable spike back up stem:[\\sim 20\\%] at stem:[392,144] elements.\r\nFor the selected mesh element size of stem:[0.2~in] and stem:[56,842] number of elements, this mesh may be seen in xref:fig-fea-mesh[].\r\n\r\n[#fig-fea-mesh_refinement-shaft]\r\n.Increasing the number of mesh elements revealed that the mesh element size of stem:[0.2~in] was sufficient and was therefore used for simulation studies reported for the remainder of this work.\r\nimage::mesh_refinement_shaft.png[caption=<span

role=text-center, width=50%]\r\n\r\nTo further demonstrate the importance of performing a mesh refinement study, examine xref:fig-fea-mesh_refinement-contact_line[].\r\nMeasured at the contacting line between the crushing face of the cam and the top of the can (best visualized in xref:fig-fea-cam-normal[]), the stress normal to the axis of the shaft was observed to vary radially.\r\nThe stem:[x]-axis of this plot is in the domain stem:[[0, \\pi\\]] because the cam requires only stem:[180^{\\circ}] rotation to crush the can.\r\nThe stresses are in the axial direction of the shaft and have a positive sense toward where the handle connects to the shaft.\r\n\r\n[#fig-fea-mesh_refinement-contact_line]\r\n.Radial distribution of normal stress in the shaft axial direction at the

</span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}", role=text-center, width=50%]\r\n\r\n\r\n==== Key Components\r\nTo corroborate those values calculated from xref:sec-design-analytical[], the effects from the applied input torque and average reaction force were examine in the shaft, handle, and contacting face of the cam.\r\nA single simulation was performed on the connected handle, shaft, inner ring of the bearings, and the cam.\r\nThe chamber housing and the other parts of the bearings were excluded from this particular simulation because those components are not the focus of this design.\r\n\r\n===== Shaft\r\n')

        __M_writer("~MPa]) indicates further work needed in designing a system that properly handle stress incurred from nominal operation.\r\nFuture effort on this project must examine a more structurally integral design for the chamber housing and perform preliminary fatigue analyses to validate the claim that such low nominal stresses pose little threat to reduce fatigue life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// [appendix#sec-appendix-Figures]\r\n// == Figures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[bibliography]\r\n== References\r\nbibliography::[]\r\n// end document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// that's all folks\r\n")

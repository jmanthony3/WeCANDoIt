To reduce the spatial requirement of the individual cans, we propose a rotationally driven high-throughput can crushing device that operates either via human or machine power to easily deform cans to at least 20% of the original volume. By utilizing a varying thickness wheel, the rotation of the wheel compresses the can against the wall of the device to less than 20% of the volume. The shaft is constructed from AISI 316 while the crushing wheel is cast stainless steel. A finite element study was conducted to validate that the stresses experienced in the design did not surpass the yield stresses of the components. The proposed device solves the issue of crushing cans and allows for automatic reloading to allow for continued operation.\r\n\r\ncite:[uguralAdvancedMechanicsMaterials2019]\r\n.Abstract\r\n// *Keywords:* _{keywords}_\r\n[#sec-intro, {counter:secs}]\r\n\r\n[#sec-nomenclature, {counter:nomenclature}]\r\n== Nomenclature\r\n\r\n[stem#eq-nomenclature, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}"]\r\n++++\r\n\\begin{align}\r\n    \\tau &= \\text{shear stress}\\')

To counteract the volumetric deman of waste faciliti\r\n\r\n:!subs:\r\n:!figs:\r\n:!tabs:\r\n\r\n[#sec-development, {counter:development}]\r\n== Development of Engineering Specifications\r\nTo develop the specifications for the design, several considerations were made to ensure that the design would be constructed effectively and within the limits of human strength. First, the average pulling force for a human was determined to be 20 lbf which is consistent with NASA standards cite:[christensenman]. In an effort to reduce the environmental impact of the design, the additional constraint of purchasing as many parts as possible without requiring custom fabricated parts. In the final design, less than half of the parts required were custom designed. The remainder were able to be purchased from McMaster-Carr. To determine the required crushing force for an aluminum beverage can, six uniaxial compression tests were conducted and the results are shown in REFERENCE CAN CRUSHING FIGURE. The avereage maximum crushing force was found to be approximately 1.3kN to reduce the can to 20% of the original volume. For the dimensions of an aluminum beverage can, the can was considered to have an original height of 157mm and to achieve 80% reduction in volume, the can would need to be deformed to a thickness of 31.4mm. The dimensions of the can were determined via measurements taken from the beverage cans used in the compression tests. Furthermore, from the project instructions, the final design was required to have te ability to be either mechanically or electrically driven. Additionally, the requirement of having the crushing mechanism automatically reload was added to improve the total throughput of the cans to be crushed. The metric for the human force and crushing force are determined via mechanical analysis. For the material selection, the commeercially listed for the components will be used in the design.\r\n\r\nINCLUDE CAN CRUSHING PLOT\r\n\r\n[#sec-synthesis, {counter:synthesis}]\r\n== Sythesis of the Design\r\nIn creating the final design of the system, several commercially and custom fabricated can crushing solutions were considered. While the common handle driven can crushing system as shown in REFERENCE HANDLE PICTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-design, {counter:design}]\r\n== Deisgn Analysis and Optimization\r\n\r\nFor analyzing the design of the can crushing mechanism, the analysis was broken down into two type: analytical and FEA. The analytical work focused on two points of interested: a point on the handle, and a point on the cross section of the shaft. Due to the complex geometry of the fly wheel, a FEA was carried out on the part assuming the maximum possible load applied by a human. \r\n\r\n=== Analytical Methods\r\n\r\n==== Shaft Cross-Section\r\nFrom Table 6.2 in cite:[uguralAdvancedMechanicsMaterials2019], the equations for the maximum shear stress, stem:[\\tau_A], and angular deflection, stem:[\\theta],  for a hexagonal cross section similar xref:fig-5-problem_statement[] to are provided:\r\n\r\nINCLUDE IMAGE OF THE HEXAGONAL CROSS SECTION\r\n\r\n[#fig-5-problem_statement]\r\n.Figure Caption\r\nimage::./2-shaft_cross_section.png[caption=<span class="figgynumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]\r\n\r\n[stem#eq-hex-cross-section, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}"]\r\n++++\r\n\\begin{align}\r\n    \\tau_A = \\frac{5.7T}{a^3}\\')
        __M_writer('    \\theta = \\frac{8.8T}{a^4G}L\r\n\\end{align}\r\n++++\r\n\r\nwhere stem:[T] is the applied torque, stem:[a] is the height of the hexagon, and stem:[G] is the modulus of rigidity. From the geometry of the shaft, stem:[a] is equal to 1 inch. For AISI 316, the shear modulus is 78GPa. For an applied torque of 220lbfÂ·in, the maximum shear stress is predicted to be 8.646MPa which closely matches the FEA results. Furthermore, the maximum predicted deflection is 2.05 milliradians. The delfection of the rod predicted via this equation is not comparable to the FEA results since the effects of the fly wheel prevent some of the deflection that would be experienced by the shaft. \r\n\r\n==== Handle\r\nThe handle of the mechanism is subject to a moment produced by the force applied to the handle. Since the cross section of the bar is rectangular, the standard equation for bending applied. At the end of the handle a force of 20 pounds force is applied. The handle has a length of 11 inches with a cross section of 0.75 inches by 0.6 inches. Using the equation for bending stress at point A on the cross section:\r\n\r\n[stem#eq-rect-cross-section, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}"]\r\n++++\r\n\\begin{equation}\r\n\\sigma_A = \\frac{M\\ y}{I}\r\n\\end{equation}\r\n++++\r\n\r\nwhere stem:[M = 20\\text{lb}_f*10.125\\text{inch} = 202.5\\text{lb}_f\\cdot\\text{inch}], stem:[y = 0.375\\text{inch}], and stem:[I = \\frac{1}{12}(0.6\\text{inch})(0.75\\text{inch})^3]. This gives a maximum normal stress of 24.8MPa. Once again, this closely matches the results determined in the FEA analysis near the point of interest. \r\n\r\n==== Conclusions\r\nWithin the brief analytical work conducted, both the shear stress in the shaft and the maximum normal stress are both well below the limits of the material. For the fly wheel, a FEA approach is employed due to the complex geometry of the contact surface with the can. The checks provided by the analytical work confirm that the FEA results are close to the predicted values. \r\n\r\nINCLUDE FIGURE OF THE HANDLE\r\n\r\n=== Finite Element Analysis\r\n\r\n[#sec-conclusions, {counter:conclusions}]\r\n== Conclusions\r\n\r\n\r\n// [appendix#sec-appendix-Figures]\r\n// == Figures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[bibliography]\r\n== Bibliography\r\nbibliography::[]\r\n// end document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// that\'s all folks')

The remainder were able to be purchased from McMaster-Carr.\r\n\r\nTo determine the required crushing force for an aluminum beverage can, six uniaxial compression tests were conducted and the results are shown in xref:fig-can_plot[].\r\nThe average maximum crushing force was found to be approximately stem:[1.3~kN] to reduce the can to stem:[20\\%] of the original volume.\r\nFor the dimensions of an aluminum beverage can, the can was considered to have an original height of stem:[157~mm] and to achieve stem:[80\\%] reduction in volume, the can would need to be deformed to a thickness of stem:[31.4~mm].\r\nThe dimensions of the can were determined via measurements taken from the beverage cans used in the compression tests.\r\nFurthermore, from the project instructions, the final design was required to have the ability to be either mechanically or electrically driven.\r\nAdditionally, the requirement of having the crushing mechanism automatically reload was added to improve the total throughput of the cans to be crushed.\r\nThe metric for the human force and crushing force are determined via mechanical analysis.\r\nFor the material selection, the commercially listed for the components will be used in the design.\r\n\r\n[#fig-can_plot]\r\n.Results from crushing six different aluminum soda cans with the regions of buckling and maximum force denoted. \r\nimage::./compression_results.png[caption=<span class="floatnumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}",role=text-center]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-synthesis, {counter:secs}]\r\n== Synthesis of the Design\r\n:!subs:\r\n:!figs:\r\n:!tabs:\r\n\r\nIn creating the final design of the system, several commercially and custom fabricated can crushing solutions were considered.\r\nWhile the common lever-based design (xref:fig-manual_device[]) allows for a can to be easily crushed, the challenge arises in creating an automated and high-throughput can crushing device.\r\nThe common industrial devices serve to shred rather than compress the aluminum cans for use in recycling facilities.\r\nBy investigating Do-It-Yourself (DIY) designs, a common method for automating the process is to create a crank-slider mechanism to compress the can.\r\nHowever, the number of moving parts in the design creates a higher likelihood of component failure if the device is operated for long periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe design of the proposed device functions on the use of a "cam" with varying thickness to compress the aluminum can against the wall of the device.\r\nThe thickness of the cam varies angularly allowing for a gradual crushing of the can.\r\nOnce the can has been reduce to stem:[20\\%] of the original volume, the can exits the device via a slot in the bottom of the housing.\r\nAs the wheel completes a revolution, the opening for a can reaches the can entry location and allows the can to drop into the crushing area.\r\nThe cam is suggested to be made from cast stainless steel.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of the cam is hexagonal and purchased from McMaster-Carr and is made from AISI 316 cite:[mcmaster-carrCorrosionResistant316316L2021].\r\nIn the current iteration, a handle purchased from McMaster-Carr cite:[mcmaster-carrCrankHandleMachinable2021] is attached to the shaft and a human is expected to provide the required rotational input to the device.\r\nHowever, a coupler could be used to attach the shaft to a motor to improve the rate of compression for the cans.\r\nThe device is shown in xref:fig-design[].\r\n\r\n[#fig-design]\r\n.Design of the can crushing device with a potion of the housing cut away to view internal crushing chamber.\r\nimage::./design.png[caption=<span class="floatnumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]\r\n\r\n[#fig-manual_device]\r\n.Example of a common design for manual can crushing devices.\r\nimage::./manual_device.jpg[caption=<span class="floatnumber">Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. </span>, reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-design, {counter:secs}]\r\n== Design Analysis and Optimization\r\n:!subs:\r\n:!figs:\r\n:!tabs:\r\n\r\nFor analyzing the design of the can crushing mechanism, the analysis was broken down into two type: analytical and FEA.\r\nThe analytical work focused on two points of interested: a point on the handle, and a point on the cross-section of the shaft.
